    "GTFS static transit data for Nairobi’s matatu system was used to engineer route-level structural features. Trips were ordered using the stop_sequence field to reconstruct the physical travel path of each route. The haversine distance between consecutive stops was summed to compute the approximate route length in kilometers. Route length ranges from 2.2 km to 41.5 km (mean = 12.3 km), which aligns with expected geography for matatu routes serving Nairobi and surrounding satellite towns. The number of stops per route ranges from 10–150, providing a useful proxy for service coverage and demand distribution."

Random Forest improved recall to 39% while maintaining 100% precision, meaning every overcrowding alert was correct but many events were still missed. This reflects the difficulty of predicting overcrowding based only on pre-event factors such as weather, time-of-day, and route structure.

    "This project set out to build a supervised machine learning system capable of predicting overcrowding and delay risk on Nairobi’s public transport network using GTFS route data, weather records, and congestion proxies. A full end-to-end workflow was implemented — from data ingestion and feature engineering, through careful target definition and model training, to rigorous evaluation and threshold optimisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key learning outcome was the identification and resolution of data leakage when travel-time was originally included both in the target construction and the feature set. Removing the leaking variable and rebuilding the models resulted in more realistic performance estimates and strengthened the scientific integrity of the study. Multiple model families were then evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost and CatBoost. While Logistic Regression provided a useful baseline, gradient boosting models consistently delivered superior performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "CatBoost emerged as the strongest model. At a tuned probability threshold of 0.35, the model achieved 98% overall accuracy, 94% precision and 100% recall for overcrowding events, meaning that virtually every high-risk period was detected while false alarms remained limited. Probability-threshold tuning proved to be an effective way to balance recall and precision depending on operational priorities. In this context, recall was prioritised because the cost of missing an overcrowding period is typically higher than the cost of a false alert.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results demonstrate that overcrowding in Nairobi’s matatu network is highly predictable using pre-event indicators such as weather, time of day and route structure, even without relying directly on real-time demand data. This provides a strong foundation for the development of early-warning tools that could support operators, regulators and city planners by informing proactive fleet allocation, service adjustments and passenger communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the work also has important limitations. The target variable was derived from indirect congestion proxies rather than true passenger counts, weather data was city-level rather than route-level, and the system has not yet been validated in a live operational setting. Future work should incorporate real passenger load data, high-resolution route-specific weather feeds, live traffic telemetry and model calibration with operational experts. Further research into fairness across routes and socioeconomic areas would also be valuable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the project successfully demonstrates that data-driven predictive analytics can play a meaningful role in improving public transport resilience and passenger experience in emerging-market cities such as Nairobi. The final model is accurate, explainable and operationally relevant, and the process reflects strong machine-learning practice — from leakage control to model comparison and threshold tuning. This work therefore represents both a technically robust and socially impactful application of supervised machine learning."
